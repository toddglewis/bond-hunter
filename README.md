1990: £292m City bonds robbery

At 9.30am on 2 May 1990, John Goddard, a 58-year-old messenger with
money broker Sheppards, was mugged at knifepoint on a quiet side street
in the City of London. Mr Goddard was taking Bank of England Treasury
bills and certificates of deposit from banks and building societies. The
bonds were in bearer form and as good as cash to anyone holding them.

The mugger escaped with 301 Treasury bills and certificates of deposit,
mostly for £1m each. The total haul was £292m. Keith Cheeseman received
a six-and-a-half-year jail sentence for his part in the robbery. Four
other people were charged in Britain with handling the bonds, but were
acquitted after the highly unusual step was taken at the opening of
their 1991 trials to offer no evidence.

Police believe the City mugging was carried out by Patrick Thomas,
a petty crook from south London. Thomas was found dead from a gunshot
wound to the head in December 1991. He was never charged with the robbery.

City of London police and the FBI infiltrated the gang involved in
laundering the bonds. The police recovered all but two of the 301 bonds
thanks to an informant.
